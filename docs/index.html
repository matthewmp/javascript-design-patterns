It's purpose is to ensure that only a single instance of a class can be instantiated. </p> <p> This is useful when you have a single object that is shared among different resources in your application without having to recreate that object. The singleton instance should be globally available to all parts of your application. </p> <p>PROS:</p> <ul> <li> Easy to implement</li> <li> Singleton prevents other objects from instantiating their own copies of the Singleton object, ensuring that all objects access the single instance.</li> <li> Flexibility to change the instantiation process.</li> </ul> <p>CONS:</p> <ul> <li> It can be difficult to change the singelton without causing problems elsewhere due to dependance. </li> <li> It can also cause race conditions in multi-threaded programming languages</li> </ul> <p>USE CASES:</p> <ul> <li> Printer spools where multiple parts of an app or multiple users access the same spooler. Having multiple instances of a spooler class would not be ideal so this pattern would make sense.</li> <li> Database connections. If you are connecting to a database from your app you would only want a single instance of this connection. Having multiple connections uses up resources on the server and if many users are trying to connect to a database while all having multiple instances on each of the users front end code it can cause blocking and unnecessary trafic. It could cause a conflict and create unpredictable behaviour and potential loss of data.</li> <li> Logging</li> <li> Any other shared resource</li> </ul> <br> <br> <hr> <h1>Behavioral Patterns</h1> <br> <br> <h2>Observer Patter</h2> <p>DESCRIPTION:</p> The observer pattern is a "Behavioral" Design Pattern. It's purpose is to alert other components when a single components state is changed. <p> PROS:</p> <ul> <li> It supports the principle of loose coupling between objects that interact with each other</li> <li> It allows sending data to other objects effectively without any change in the Subject or Observer classes</li> <li> Observers can be added/removed at any point in time</li> </ul> <p> CONS:</p> <ul> <li>Due to the dynamic relationship between subscribers and publishers, the update dependency can be difficult to track.</li> </ul> <p>USE CASES:</p> <ul> <li> Social media notifications to "friends" when status is updated</li> <li> In programming this is similar to an event listener</li> </ul> <br> <br> <br> <div class="divider"></div> <center><h3>Observer Pattern Example</h3></center> <div id="oberservers-wrapper"> <div class="observer-container"> <span class="content" id="inp1"></span> </div> <div class="observer-container"> <span class="content" id="inp2"></span> </div> <div class="observer-container"> <span class="content" id="inp3"></span> </div> </div> <div id="scoreboard"> <h2>Score Board</h2> <button id="btnIncrementScore" type="button">Increment Score</button> <div id="scoreBoard-score"></div> </div> <div class="divider"></div> <script src="/javascript-design-patterns.465a6ce3.js"></script>
